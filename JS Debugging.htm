    <!--Errors can (will) happen, every time you write some new computer code.
        Searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called code debugging.
    -->

    <!--The console.log() Method-->

    <h2>My First Web Page</h2>

    <p>Activate debugging in your browser (Chrome, IE, Firefox) with F12, and select "Console" in the debugger menu.</p>

    <script>
        a = 5;
        b = 6;
        c = a + b;
        console.log(c);
    </script>

    <!--The debugger Keyword-->

    <h2>JavaScript Debugger</h2>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <p>With the debugger turned on, the code below should stop executing before it executes the third line.</p>

    <script>
        let x = 15 * 5;
        debugger;
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
    </script>

    <!--Debugging is the process of testing, finding, and reducing bugs (errors) in computer programs.
        The first known computer bug was a real bug (an insect) stuck in the electronics.
