    <!--
        1. Accidentally using the assignment operator (=) instead of a comparison operator (===)

        2. Expecting loose comparison.

        3. Forgetting that "switch" statements use strict comparison.

        4. Confusing addition & concatenation.

        5. Misunderstanding floats.

        6. Breaking a JavaScript string. You must use a "backslash(\)" if you must break a statement in a string.

        7. Misplacing semicolon.

        8. Breaking a return statement. Never break a return statement.

        9. Accessing arrays with named indexes. In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes.
           (In JavaScript, objects use named indexes.)
        
        10.Ending definitions with a comma.

        11.Undefined is not null. If you want to test if an object is not null, you must test if it's not undefined first.
