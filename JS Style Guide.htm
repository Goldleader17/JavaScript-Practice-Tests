    <!--
        Coding conventions are style guidelines for programming. They typically cover:
        * Naming and declaration rules for variables and functions.
        * Rules for the use of white space, indentation, and comments.
        * Programming practices and principles.

        Coding conventions secure quality:
        * Improve code readability.
        * Make code maintenance easier.
    -->

    <!--Variable Names: 
            * Use camelCase for identifier names (variables and functions).
            * Global variables written in UPPERCASE.
            * Constants (like PI) written in UPPERCASE.

            [NB: Hyphens can be mistaken as subtraction attempts.
            They are not allowed in JavaScript names.
            Do not start names with a $ sign. It'll put you in conflict with many JavaScript library names.
            ]

        Spaces around operators: Always put spaces around operators (= + - * /), and after commas.

        Code Indentation: Always use 2 spaces for indentation of code blocks. Do not use tabs.

        Statement Rules:
        General rules for simple statements:
            * Always end a simple statement with a semicolon.

        General rules for complex statements:  
            * Put the opening bracket at the end of the first line.
            * Use one space before the opening bracket.
            * Put the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
            * Do not end a complex statement with a semicolon.
        E.g:
            function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
            return (5 / 9) * (fahrenheit - 32);
            }
        
        Object Rules:
            * Place the opening bracket on the same line as the object name.
            * Use colon plus one space between each property and its value.
            * Use quotes around string values, not around numeric values.
            * Do not add a comma after the last property-value pair.
            * Place the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
            * Always end an object definition with a semicolon.
        E.g:
            const person = {
                firstName: "John",
                lastName: "Doe",
                age: 50,
                eyeColor: "blue"
            };
        Line Length < 80: For readability avoid lines longer than 80 characters.
    -->

    <!--
        Coding conventions are not used by computers. Most rules have little impact on the execution of programs.
        Indentation and extra spaces are not significant in small scripts.
        For code in development, readability should be preferred. Large production scripts should be minimized.
