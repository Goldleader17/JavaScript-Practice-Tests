    <!--How to speed up your JavaScript code:

        1. Reduce activity in loops. Statements that can be placed outside the loop will make the loop run faster.

        2. Reduce DOM access.

        3. Reduce DOM size.

        4. Avoid unnecessary variables.

        5. Avoid using "with" keyword.

        6. Delay Javascript loading. place scripts at the bottom of the page body.

        The HTTP specification defines that browsers should not download more than two components in parallel.
        An alternative is to use 'defer="true"' in the script tag. The defer attribute specifies that the script should be executed after the page has finished parsing, but it only works for external scripts.
        If possible, you can add your script to the page by code, after the page has loaded.

    <h2>JavaScript Performance</h2>

    <p>If you expect to access a DOM element several times, access it once, and the use it as a local variable:</p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
        const obj = 
        document.getElementById("demo");
        obj.innerHTML = "Hello";
    </script>
