<!--JavaScript has 8 datatypes; String, Number, Bigint, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, & Object.

THE OBJECT DATATYPE: 
This can contain: An object, An array, & A data

NB: A JavaScript variable can hold any type of data.

When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.

JavaScript evaluates different sequences fron left to right. Different sequences can produce different results.

Strings are written with quotes, u can use single or double quotes.
* U can use quotes inside a string as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string.

JavaScript numbers are always one type: double (64-bit floating point).

A variable without a value has the value - undefined. The type is also undefined.

An empty value is not undefined.
